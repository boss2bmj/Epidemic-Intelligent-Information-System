    \subsection{Monitoring more diseases}
        Currently, our system is designed for monitoring some of disease that are under surveillance of Ministry of Public Health, Thailand which are HIV, AIDS, TB, Hepatitis, and STD. However, we plan to scale up our system by having our system monitoring more diseases that are under surveillance of Ministry of Public Health such as Malaria, Dengue etc.
    \subsection{Automated Updating On Receiving New Data Sources}
        % bot
        % merge and indexed
        % Information Technology and Communication Center
        At the moment, when the 43 folders were sent to Information Technology and Communication Center, ICT Center already provided rsync command to update the data into the production server. Nevertheless, we have to merge and index the new data with existing data manually. We plan to implement the automated task for merging and indexing the data when there is any update of the data from ICT Center.
